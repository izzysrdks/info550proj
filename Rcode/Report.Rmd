### This is an analysis of the association between Change in Engagement and Change in TNF Alpha.  

Figure 1. Graph of Change in Engagement vs. Change in TNF alpha

Regression Table for TNF alpha on Engagement, stratified by change  

```{r}
Full_data <- read.csv("../clean_data/Full_data.csv")
model <- lm(change_TNF ~ change_engage*group, data=Full_data) 
model %>%
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    p.value = scales::pvalue(p.value),
   term = c("Intercept", "Change in Engagement", "Group B", "Group C", "Interaction with Group B", "Interaction with Group A")
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(
  	caption = "Linear Regression of Change in TNF alpha on Change in Engagement by Group",
    col.names = c("Predictor", "B", "SE", "t", "p"),
    digits = c(0, 2, 3, 2, 3),
    align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r"))
```
  
Only the intercept is significant at the alpha = 0.05 level and so we conclude that the groups have different changes in TNF alpha, but the affect of engagement on TNF alpha is insignificant.
